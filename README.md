# Random Internet Screenshots from prnt.sc
### [Experience here](https://internetscreenshots.com)

This project generates 1-10 number of random links to prnt.sc site, where you can view random screenshots from people all over the internet. Why? Cause I felt bored on a particular sunday afternoon.

If you decide to fork or mess around the code or deploy on your own, make sure to remove my google analytics/fb pixel tags from the header. Cheers.

Made with good old *jQuery*
